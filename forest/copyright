This is USDA Forest and Economics policy data.

The data was imported by Quinn Hart <qjhart@ucdavis.edu>, originally
around 2012-02-21 from sources obtained from:

This data is either in the public domain, as federal data, or not
specified.  The following disclaimer is included:

These data were collected from different sources, each with their own
currentness. Data on pulp mills across the continental United States
were based on best available information as of February 2005. Data on
other mills in Western states and in Texas were collected in
2004. Data on other mills from the remaining Southern states were
collected from 1999 to 2001. Mill data for northern and north central
states have thus far not been updated since our previous 2000 dataset,
so mill data in these states are derived from data collected between
1994 and 1998. However, data for pulp mills in this and all the other
regions were updated based on an FPL survey conducted in 2000. Some
mills may have closed or idled, relocated, or changed their name or
address since their information was collected. For pulp mills some
effort was made to update their name, address and operational status
as of 2005. This was not undertaken for other mill types.
